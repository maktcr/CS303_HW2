# CS303_HW2


The program has two seperate parts for the different questions from the assignment. The first part includes the main .cpp file (CS303_HW2.cpp) and the class implimentation in the Single_Linked_List.h header file. The first part starts running automatically and asks the user for input at certain points. User input should be given as a number, there is no error checking to account for invalid user inputs. There is no menu, the functions run one at a time in a predetermined order.

The second portion of the assignment include the main .cpp file, Stack.cpp, and Stack.h. Stack.h includes the declaration of the Stack class, while Stack.cpp includes the function definitions for the Stack class. The stack class is implimented using the std::vector class and uses many of the vector classes functions. This portion of the code does not require any user input, instead, the functions run automatically and display the result of the functions to the user.
